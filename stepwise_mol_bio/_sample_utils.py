# Group object:
# - easy to pass around
# - clear about common vs variable
# - can't use generic tools

# Sample class:
# - Constructor that can initialize known attrs.
#   - Bindable already does this, but might want to move that feature.
# - Shortcut to make factory with partial args.
#   - Basically: take kwargs, invoke ctor with those args.

# I might want to write the group objects so that they can group on attributes 
# that raise exceptions, and the same exception will be raised when the 
# attribute is later accessed.  Otherwise, every attribute that could be used 
# in a function needs to have a value, even if in some cases that value 
# wouldn't make sense.  Basically this forces me to specify a lot of defaults 
# that I otherwise wouldn't need to.

    Allow a function to be called with either samples or groups, whichever is 
    convenient for the caller.

    The decorated function will always be passed a group object, since that 
    makes it easy to access shared attributes. The function must either (i) 
    only take one argument or (ii) have exactly one argument annotated as a 
    `Group`.  The value associated with that argument will be extracted, 
    converted to a group if necessary, then passed to the function.

    It is not necessary to specify any *attrs*, but if you do, the decorated 
    function will also have a `for_groups_in` generator attached to it.  This 
    generator will have the same signature as the original function, except 
    that the group argument will now be expected to be an iterable.  That 
    iterable will be broken into groups according to the given attributes, then 
    each group will be passed to the original function and yielded.

    # Automatically determine attrs
    # =============================
    # It would be nice to determine the *attrs* argument automatically, since 
    # in principle all the information is there in the code.  There are a few 
    # ways to try doing this:
    #
    # - Call the function with a mock object and record attribute accesses.
    #
    #   This probably isn't a very good idea.  There might be conditionals that 
    #   the code doesn't visit, and errors could be triggered if there are 
    #   checks for certain attribute values.  That said, it would just be a 
    #   default.
    #
    # - Parse the AST:
    #
    #   Getting an AST requires having access to the source code, which 
    #   function objects don't really have (they can just try to look it up in 
    #   the filesystem knowing their qualified names).  This means the AST is 
    #   unavailable for C-extensions and code defined in the interpreter.  That 
    #   said, source should be available for any application I can envision.
    # 
    #   Pseudocode:
    #   - Look for all uses of the group argument
    #     - If attribute access: record that
    #     - If assignment: start looking for that variable too
    #     - If function call: recurse into that function
    #
    #   Note that the PCR code makes use of getattr.  That would be pretty much 
    #   impossible to account for.
    #
    # - Parse the bytecode:
    #
    #   Bytecode is lower-level than the AST, but it's available for any 
    #   function object.  There are two things I'd need to look for: attribute 
    #   accesses and function calls.  Attribute access aren't too bad.  It 
    #   seems like they'd always be LOAD_FAST(0) followed by LOAD_ATTR.  (The 0 
    #   is because the group is always the first argument.)  Function calls are 
    #   more difficult, though.  The pattern will be LOAD_GLOBAL (for the 
    #   function), followed by LOAD_FAST for each argument, followed by 
    #   CALL_FUNCTION.  There are also the CALL_FUNCTION_KW and 
    #   CALL_FUNCTION_EX opcodes, with slightly different usages.  It probably 
    #   could be done, but it'd be intricate.
    #
    # Force programmer to provide attrs
    # =================================
    # As an alternative to the magic above, I could raise an error whenever an 
    # undeclared attribute is accessed.  Note that I couldn't simply delete 
    # undeclared attributes, because they might be used in called functions. 
    #
    # I could write the code such that the checks go away in -O mode, or in the 
    # absence of some environment variable.
